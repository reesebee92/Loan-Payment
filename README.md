# Loan-Payment

The purpose of this project was to practice the use of object oriented programming and creating a GUI for Loan repayment calculations.

Design

The specifications of the program are to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to calculate loan payments for an individual. The user is required to enter data for three fields: annual interest rate, the term of the loan, and the loan amount. Given this information and a click of the calculate button, the monthly and total payment amounts will be displayed. My program will use 5 text fields accompanied by 5 labels. There will also be a labeled calculate button with a handy tooltip.

What I Learned

The greatest thing I learned while doing this project is how to use and implement the java text NumberFormat class. I used this class to format my GUI output for the monthly and total payment text fields. It took multiple tries, but I figured out how to use it! If I have to create GUIs in the future, I would like to figure out how to use JFormattedTextField and Masks.
